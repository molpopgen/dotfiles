# Dotfiles

## Notes

`clang-format` needs to be `.clang-format`.  Put it either in `~/` or the root of a C/C++ project.

## Setting up fonts

1. Install Fira Code.
   * Version from OS package manager is good enough.
2. Download NerdFontsSymbolsOnly.zip from the latest nerd fonts releases
   * extract into ~/.fonts
   * `fc-cache -fv`

### kitty

Note: `kitty.conf` explicitly maps the dev icons to the nerd fonts symbols.
